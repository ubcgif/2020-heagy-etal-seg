abstract = {This article presents state-of-the-art unexploded ordnance detection and classification, including examples from recent field-demonstration studies. After reviewing sensor technologies, with a focus on magnetic and electromagnetic systems, the authors discuss advanced processing techniques that allow for reliable discrimination between hazardous ordnance and harmless metallic clutter. Finally, the article shows results from a large-scale field demonstration conducted in 2011. In this case study, electromagnetic data acquired with an advanced sensor is used to identify ordnance at the site, reducing the number of excavations re-quired with conventional metal detectors by 85{\%}. T he extent of global unexploded ordnance contamination has mo-tivated research into improved technologies for unexploded ordnance de-tection and classification. In particular, the U.S. Department of Defense's Environmental Science Technology Certification Program has funded the development of sensors and data-processing techniques specially designed to re-liably identify buried UXO. As part of this research effort, ESTCP con-ducted a series of field demonstrations to vali-date detection and classification technologies. The first demonstration, conducted in 2010 at Camp Sibert, Alabama (U.S.), required the discrimination of large 4.2-in mortars from metallic ordnance debris.},

abstract = {In a study at a military range with the objective to discriminate potentially hazardous -inch mortars from nonhazardous shrapnel, range, and cultural debris, six different discrimination techniques were tested using data from an array of magnetometers, a time-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) cart, an array of time-domain sensors, and a time-domain EMI cart with a wider measurement bandwidth. Discrimination was achieved using rule-based or statistical classification of feature vectors extracted from dipole or polarization tensor models fit to detected anomalies. For magnetics, the ranking by moment yielded better discrimination results than that of apparent remanence from relatively large remanent magnetizations of several of the seeded items. The magnetometer results produced very accurate depths and fewer failed fits attributable to noisy data or model insuffi-ciency. The EMI-based methods were more effective than the magnetometer for intrinsic discrimination ability. The higher signal-to-noise ratio, denser coverage, and more precise positioning of the EM-array data resulted in fewer false positives than the EMI cart. When depth constraints from the magnetometer data were used to constrain the EMI fits through cooperative inversion, discrimination performance improved considerably. The wide-band EMI sensor was deployed in a cued-interrogation mode over a subset of anomalies. This produced the highest-quality data because of collecting the densest data around each target and the additional late time-decay information available with the wide-band sensor. When the depth from the magnetometer was used as a constraint in the cooperative inversion process, all -inch mortars were recovered before any false positives were encountered. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {We develop an inversion technique to process overlapping data that arise from closely spaced targets. In contrast to a usual single-object inversion model, a multiobject problem is more challenging because of the increased number of parameters to be found and because of the additional nonlinearity and nonuniqueness. Our solution strategy is to break down the full problem into a sequence of smaller problems so that optimization is conducted in a lower dimensional model space. In the numerical implementation, a set of nonlinear model parameters, e.g., the locations of the underlying sources, is sought while the set of linear model parameters, i.e., their polarization tensors, are updated accordingly in a nested manner. This is an explicit separable nonlinear optimization technique that we cast. We employ a joint diagonalization to find an average principal direction among multiple magnetic polarizability tensors. Since the principal directions are more sensitive to the inaccuracies in the estimated polarization tensor, we suggest a subsequent procedure to optimize the two sets of parameters: orientation and principal polarizations of objects. For initialization, we propose a selected multistart nonlinear algorithm for source localizations that paves an efficient way to find a good initial guess of model parameters and makes the nonlinear inversion effectively automated. We report the new applications of the technique to the test-stand and field data acquired with next-generation sensor systems of the TEMTADS and MetalMapper and study the issue of the spatial resolution of overlapping anomalies through inversions and using the metric defined as the total uncertainty of the polarizabilities. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Away from a conductive body, secondary magnetic fields due to currents induced in the body by a time-varying external magnetic field are approximated by (equivalent) magnetic dipole fields. Approximating the external magnetic field by its value at the location of the equivalent magnetic dipoles, the equivalent magnetic dipoles' strengths are linearly proportional to the external magnetic field, for a given time dependence of external magnetic field, and are given by the equivalent dipole polarizability matrix. The polarizability matrix and its associated equivalent dipole location are estimated from magnetic field measurements made with at least three linearly independent polarizations of external magnetic fields at the body. Uncertainties in the polarizability matrix elements and its equivalent dipole location are obtained from analysis of a linearized inversion for polarizability and dipole location. Polarizability matrix uncertainties are independent of the scale of the polarizability matrix. Dipole location uncertainties scale inversely with the scale of the polarizability matrix. Uncertainties in principal polarizabilities and directions are obtained from the sensitivities of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to perturbations of a symmetric matrix. In application to synthetic data from a magnetic conducting sphere and to synthetic data from an axially symmetric elliptic conducting body, the estimated polarizability matrices, equivalent dipole locations, and principal polarizabilities and directions are consistent with their estimated uncertainties.},

abstract = {Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7{\%} in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the modern era of diminishing returns on fixed exploration budgets, challenging targets, and ever-increasing numbers of multi-parameter datasets, proper management and integration of available data is a crucial component of any mineral exploration program. Machine learning algorithms have successfully been used for years by the technology sector to accomplish just this task on their databases, and recent developments aim at appropriating these successes to the field of mineral exploration. Framing the exploration task as a supervised learning problem, the geological, geochemical and geophysical information can be used as training data, and known mineral occurences can be used as training labels. The goal is to parameterize the complex relationships between the data and the labels such that mineral potential can be estimated in under-explored regions using available geoscience data. Numerous models and algorithms have been attempted for mineral prospectivity mapping in the past, and in this thesis we propose two new approaches. The first is a modified support vector machine algorithm which incorporates uncertainties on both the data and the labels. Due to the nature of geoscience data and the characteristics of the mineral prospectivity mapping problem, uncertainties are known to be very important. The algorithm is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset to highlight this importance, and then used to generate a prospectivity map for copper-gold porphyry targets in central British Columbia using the QUEST dataset as a case study. The second approach, convolutional neural networks, was selected due to its inherent sensitivity to spatial patterns. Though neural networks have been used for mineral prospectivity mapping, convolutional neural nets have yet to be applied to the problem. Having gained extreme popularity in the computer vision field for tasks involving image segmentation, identification and anomaly detection, the algorithm is ideally suited to handle the mineral prospectivity mapping problem. A CNN code is developed in Julia, then tested on a synthetic example to illustrate its effectiveness at identifying coincident structures in a multi-modal dataset. Finally, a subset of the QUEST dataset is used to generate a prospectivity map using CNNs.},

abstract = {Tracking a horizon in seismic images or 3D volumes is an integral part of seismic interpretation. The last few decades saw progress in using neural networks for this task, starting from shallow networks for 1D traces, to deeper convolutional neural networks for large 2D images. Because geological structures are intrinsically 3D, we hope to see improved horizon tracking by training networks on 3D seismic data cubes. While there are some 3D convolutional neural networks for various seismic interpretation tasks, they are restricted to shallow networks or relatively small 3D inputs because of memory limitations. The required memory for the network states and weights increases with network depth. We present a fully reversible network for horizon tracking that has a memory requirement that is independent of network depth. To tackle memory issues regarding the network weights, we use layers that train in a factorized form directly. Therefore, we can maintain a large number of network channels while keeping the number of convolutional kernels low. We use the saved memory to increase the input size of the data by order of magnitude such that the network can better learn from large structures in the data. A field data example verifies the proposed network structure is suitable for seismic horizon tracking.},

EMI classification of an unknown subsurface target is based on estimating the target's magnetic polarizability tensor from data collected above the ground. One can discrimi- nate between different targets only if their polarizability tensors are sufficiently different. In this paper, we review the relationship between the time and frequency dependence of the polar- izability tensor, evaluate the relative information content of the time and frequency domain signatures, and discuss how the sensor response affects signature measurement fidelity. Our analysis centers on simple parametric representations for the time and frequency domain EMI signatures that have been synthesized from extensive empirical studies of the EMI response of ordnance and clutter items. There are three basic parameters (amplitude factor, time constant and demagnetization factor) for each of the target's principal axes. They are related to the physical characteristics of the target and can be used for classification and discrimination.},

We compare a local uncertainty estimate derived from the curvature of the misfit function with global estimates of the model posterior probability density (PPD) obtained with Markov chain sampling. For well-posed experiments (i.e., with high SNR and adequate spatial coverage), the two methods of uncertainty appraisal agree. However, when the inverse problem is ill posed, we find out that the PPD can be multimodal. To incorporate these uncertainties in discrimination, we first develop an extension of discriminant analysis which integrates over the posterior distribution of the model. When dealing with multimodal PPDs, we show that an effective solution is to input all modes of the PPD - corresponding to all models at local minima of the misfit - into discrimination and, then, to classify on the basis of the model which is most likely a UXO. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {? Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) discrimination is achieved by extracting parameters from geophysical data that reflect characteristics of the target that generated the measured signal. Model-based parameters are estimated through data inversion, where the optimal parameters are those that produce acceptable agreement between observed and predicted data and satisfy any prior information we have of the target. These parameters are then used as inputs to statistical classification methods to determine the likelihood that the target is, or is not, a UXO. The task of accurately recovering model parameters is more difficult when sensor data are contaminated with geological noise originating from magnetic soils. In regions of highly magnetic soil, magnetometry and electromagnetic sensors often detect large anomalies that are of geologic, rather than of metallic origin. In this thesis I investigate different methods of recovering the dipole polarization tensor from time domain electromagnetic (TEM) data. The different data inversion methods are characterized by the amount of a priori information used. Different a priori information considered include target location and depth estimated from other data sets, and knowledge of the different types of UXO that can be expected at the site. In the first part of this thesis, I assume that the influence of background geology can be removed through a data pre-processing procedures such that the UXO can be assumed to sit in free space. In the second part of this thesis we take a closer look at the influence of viscous remnant magnetization on electromagnetic data. Several software and hardware based approaches are proposed for improving detection and discrimination of UXO in geologically magnetic areas.},

abstract = {Recent advances in time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) sensors have dramatically improved discrimination of buried unexploded ordnance (UXO). In contrast to commercial standard mono-static sensors, the multi-static, multi-component geometries of next generation TEM sensors provide diverse excitations of a detected target. Inversion of observed data using the parametric TEM dipole model typically produces well-constrained estimates that can subsequently be inputted into a discrimination algorithm. In particular, the principal dipole polarizabilities provide information about target size and shape. Shape is represented by two transverse polarizabilities orthogonal to a target's axis of symmetry.Equality of transverse polarizabilities is diagnostic of an axisymmetric body of revolution and so has been proposed as a useful feature to discriminate between axisymmetric UXO and non-axisymmetric metallic clutter. Here we show that estimated transverse polarizabilities can sometimes be poorly constrained in an inversion of multi-static TEM data. This motivates our development of a regularized inversion algorithm that penalizes the deviation between transverse polarizabilities. We then develop an extension of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier that uses all models obtained via regularized inversion to make discrimination decisions. This approach achieves the best performance of all candidate discrimination algorithms applied to a number of real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To extract intrinsic polarization parameters of a buried object from electromagnetic induction (EMI) responses, one has to first find its location. We developed an efficient method to find the approximate locations of multiple ordnance items using time domain electromagnetic data. The procedure was based upon the principle of multiple signal classification which exploits the orthogonality of signal and noise subspaces of multistatic EMI data. For an arbitrary multistatic array, we formulated transmitter-based and receiver-based imaging or steering vectorial operators that related with the left and right singular vectors of a multistatic response matrix. The operators were computed at potential source locations and are mapped onto the noise subspaces derived from data. A spatial metric function was therefore introduced to measure the magnitude of the projection. A 3D source imaging of the metric function could be obtained by evaluating all potential locations over a region of interest. In ideal cases, the perfect orthogonality between the computed signal subspace and measured noisy subspace can be achieved at or near a target location, and rendered an imaging peak at that location. Conversely, the peak image locations obtained from this technique were used as the indicators for where targets were most likely present. The number of targets could be estimated from the rank of the data matrix, provided there were a sufficient number of transmitters and receivers. In some instances the locations of multiple targets were imaged directly, but the procedure was enhanced by stripping the effect of a larger or shallower target from the image. The technique was evaluated using the test-stand and field data, and compared with the standard nonlinear inversion. The results showed that it has potential capability to accurately localize sources in EMI sensing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {For classification problems where the test data are labeled sequentially, the point at which all true positives are first identified is often of critical importance. This article develops hypothesis tests to assess whether all true positives have been labeled in the test data. The tests use a partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) that is generated from a labeled subset of the test data. These methods are developed in the context of unexploded ordnance (UXO) classification, but are applicable to any binary classification problem. First, the likelihood of the observed ROC given binormal model parameters is derived using order statistics, leading to a nonlinear parameter estimation problem. I then derive the approximate distribution of the point on the ROC at which all true instances are found. Using estimated binormal parameters, this distribution can be integrated up to a desired confidence level to define a critical false alarm rate (FAR). If the selected operating point is before this critical point, then additional labels out to the critical point are required. A second test uses the uncertainty in binormal parameters to determine the critical FAR. These tests are demonstrated with UXO classification examples and both approaches are recommended for testing operating points. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},
